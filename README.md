The footprint of this project is about 250MB.
Sudachi dictionary is 200MB.
The word embeddings from entire Japanese Wikipedia is 50MB.

(Please see Development Environment section located on bottom too)
### Runtime set up
#### 1. Install GiNZA NLP Library with Japanese Universal Dependencies Model
Run following line
```
pip install "https://github.com/megagonlabs/ginza/releases/download/v1.0.2/ja_ginza_nopn-1.0.2.tgz"
```
or download pip install archive from [release page](https://github.com/megagonlabs/ginza/releases) and
specify it as below.
```
pip install ja_ginza_nopn-1.0.2.tgz
```
#### 2. Test
Run following line and input some Japanese text + Enter, then you can see the parsed results with conllu format.
```
python -m spacy.lang.ja_ginza.cli
```
### Coding example
Following steps shows dependency parsing results with sentence boundary 'EOS'.
```
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('ja_ginza_nopn')
doc = nlp('依存構造解析の実験を行っています。')
for sent in doc.sents:
    for token in sent:
        print(token.i, token.orth_, token.lemma_, token.pos_, token.dep_, token.head.i)
    print('EOS')
```
### APIs
Please see [spaCy API documents](https://spacy.io/api/).
## Releases

## Development Environment
### Development set up
#### 1. Clone from github
```
git clone --recursive 'https://github.com/megagonlabs/ginza.git'
```
#### 2. Run ./setup.sh
For normal environment:
```
./setup.sh
```
For GPU environment(cuda92):
```
./setup_cuda92.sh
```
### Training
Prepare nopn_embedding/, nopn/, and kwdlc/ in your project directory, then run below.
(We're preparing the descriptions of training environment. Coming soon.)
```
shell/build.sh nopn 1.0.2
```
You can speed up training and analyze process by adding -g option if GPUs available.

After a while, you will find pip installable archive.
```
target/ja_ginza_nopn-1.0.2.tgz
```
